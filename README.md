Summary

To predict global sales, I began by conducting data analysis to uncover insights. After preprocessing the dataset and splitting it into features and the target variable, I evaluated several regression models through cross-validation, selecting Linear Regression for its simplicity and performance. Following model training, predictions were made on the test data, and performance metrics (MSE, MAE, R^2) were assessed. Additionally, I interpreted model coefficients to understand the relationship between features and global sales.
